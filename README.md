# VSDNASSCOM---Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning
This repository contains documentation from a 5-day hands-on workshop on Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning, conducted by VSD Corp using open-source EDA tools and the Google SkyWater 130 nm PDK.
The workshop focuses on implementing a complete RTL-to-GDSII flow using tools such as OpenLANE, Magic, Ngspice, and TritonRoute.

Screenshots of all completed lab exercises are available in the master branch for reference and verification.
